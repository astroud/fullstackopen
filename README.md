# Fullstack Open

My answers to the exercises on fullstackopen.com

Initially, this repo contained all of my [Full Stack open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) answers.

In Part 3, I split the lesson examples and exercises into their own repos to simplify deployment.

## Lesson examples:
* [Notes Frontend](https://github.com/astroud/fullstackopen-notes-frontend)
